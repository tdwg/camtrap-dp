The example dataset is derived from an existing camera trap study and aims to illustrate the Camtrap DP format. Since it is included and versioned with Camtrap DP, it can be used as a valid test dataset for each version.

## Background

The dataset is derived from a [camera trap study](https://lifemica.eu/research-innovaties/camera-tracking/) designed to detect invasive muskrat and coypu populations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The study was led by Emma Cartuyvels and coordinated by the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://inbo.be). Data were managed and annotated at event-level in [Agouti.eu](https://www.agouti.eu/). The full dataset is published to the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://doi.org/10.15468/5tb6ze). The example dataset contains four deployments of the original dataset (all located in Belgium) and was expanded to include media-based observations in addition to event-based ones.

## Use cases

The selected deployments covers a wide range of use cases:

- [Blank](../example/29b7d356/#1d98da96)
- [Unknown](../example/577b543a/#5fbf69a4)
- [Vehicle](../example/62c200a9/#962dff14) (with hidden media files)
- [Setup with human](../example/00a2c20d/#99880973) (with hidden media files)
- [Timelapse image](../example/577b543a/#8f779513)
- [AI-classified observation](../example/62c200a9/#4dcacd8f) with bounding boxes
- [Animals of mixed species and sex](../example/00a2c20d/#79204343)
- [Animals of mixed lifestage](../example/00a2c20d/#ea72c74f)
- [Animal appearing and disappearing](../example/00a2c20d/#45abeadc) throughout the event
- [Animals passing by](../example/29b7d356/#45ee3031) resulting in a higher count for the event than any single media file
