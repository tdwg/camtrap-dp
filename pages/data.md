Data in Camtrap DP are organized as three related resources (CSV files): `deployments`, `media` and `observations`. These [Tabular Data Resources](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) are described as `resources` in the `datapackage.json` file (see [Metadata](../metadata)). The descriptions of their fields follow the [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) specifications and are presented below in human-readable form. Fields indicated with `*` are required (i.e. cannot be empty).
