# Camera Trap Data Package

**Camera Trap Data Package** (or **Camtrap DP** for short) is a community developed data exchange standard for camera trap data. A Camtrap DP is a [Frictionless Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) that consists of:

file | definition | specification
--- | --- | ---
`datapackage.json` | Metadata regarding the data package and camera trap project. | [camtrap-dp-profile.json](camtrap-dp-profile.json)
`deployments.csv` | Table with camera trap deployments. Includes `deployment_id`, start, end, location and camera setup. | [deployments-table-schema.json](deployments-table-schema.json)
`multimedia.csv` | Table with multimedia files (images/videos) captured by camera traps. Associated with deployments (`deployment_id`) and organized in sequences (`sequence_id`). Includes timestamp and file location. | [multimedia-table-schema.json](multimedia-table-schema.json)
`observations.csv` | Table with camera trap observations. Associated with deployments (`deployment_id`) and based on one or more multimedia files (`sequence_id` and optionally `multimedia_id`), covering a sequence start/end time interval. Observations can contain species (with multiple observations for groups of certain count, age, sex, behaviour and/or individuals) or not (empty, setup/pickup). | [observations-table-schema.json](observations-table-schema.json)

The specifications build upon existing standards:

- `camtrap-package-profile.json`: an extension of [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/), itself a [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/).
- `deployments-table-schema.json`, `multimedia-table-schema.json`, `observations-table-schema.json`: [Table Schemas](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) describing the fields, contraints and requirements for a [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/).
